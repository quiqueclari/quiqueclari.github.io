Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

My name is Quique (short for Enrique) Clari and I am a “la Caixa” INPhINIT predoctoral researcher and a PhD candidate at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) in the Department of Political Science and International Relations. I graduated in Law and Political Science at the University of Valencia (UV) and hold a master degree in Political Theory from the London School of Economics (LSE). In my PhD project, directed by Guillermo Cordero (UAM) and Enrique Hernández (UAB), I research Europeans’ attitudes towards democracy, focusing in particular on the question whether public support for liberal values and principles has declined in the last decade.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, monographs, and translations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me and my work.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nLink to ORCID profile"
